  Today is Diwali and i am very happy, I am sitting with my son SUJAY-SANJAY-DEVIDAS-DEVCHAND-CHANGO-DAGDU-BHIKA-GANPAT-BHALERAO :)
  The reason I am very very happy is ,my son started  maintaining his  github, and started writing blogs too.
  This is very important, as our fore coming  generation will have access to this, they we come to know, how we used to code. 
  Sujay my son , has actually completed this C course last year at this writing his age is 12 years as of today.  
  And today he started to share it to the world. Good luck Chiku (pet name) 

  Tomorrow there is Demo with my client, for SOC application which I ave written in C, lets see how he takes it.
